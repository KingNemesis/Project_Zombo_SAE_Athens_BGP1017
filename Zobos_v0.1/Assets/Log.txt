14-11-18 - Jim P
Time: n/a
Added: Current scene based on Themis' scene, has functional Player <Player_CC3> with working CharacterControlled movement. InputManager on <Mothership>
	controls input for playerMovementScript, cameraLookScript, shootingScript.
Todo: Better shooting( raycast change, weapon swap, (weapon pickup?), weapon aim, weapon spread, dynamic weapon sway ).
=================

Time: ~40h
Added: 
>Better Shooting. 
	- Weapon Aim, now can aim with right click, which changes weapon spread and camera FOV appropriately.
	- Weapon Spread, depending on mode of firing (hip/aim), aim changes appropriately - currently not dynamic
		(spread is either x or y, doesn't interpolate based on amount of time firing).
	- Dynamic weapon sway, gun behavior was modified by adding a sense of weight to the gun.
	- Weapon Recoil, firing for long periods of time, kicks back the gun and changes the camera angle.
	- Weapon SFX, created input points for weapon sound effects both gun firing and bullet hitting objects.
	- Headbob, copy/ pasted older script for some head movement, probably a placeholder!
>Placeholder SFX.
	- 2 available SFX for shooting from http://soundbible.com/tags-gun.html.
	General scripts: CopyMainCameraFOVScript, syncs GunCamera with PlayerCamera
	Unused scripts: BulletScript
>Prefabs.
	- AudioSource_Gunhit_1, is the prefab which handles the hitSFX sound, don't mess with it, just assign proper sound in GunScript.
	Unused prefabs: Bullet
Changed: 
	- Better Crosshairs, now part of the IMGUI system, change pseudo-dynamicly with player actions (currently shooting).
	- Raycast from gun was changed, now gun fires realistically from hip and aimed position*.
	* EXPERIMENTAL OPTIONS for gun aim, Gun Script by default has enabled some options where the gun tries to always center itself to the middle
		of the screen - relative to the object the user is currently aimed at. Feature is not at final state, feels glitchy and basicly weird but
		it does do what should do at final state!
	- Rifle model was changed abit.
Todo: Finish up with Weapon Spread, Headbob, Gunbob, Even better Crosshairs, Fix Gun Aim to not be glitchy.
